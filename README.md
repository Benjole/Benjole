## Hi there 👋 Im Benjamin,

### About me
I'm a student in theoretical physics, also interested in Data Sciences !
I am currently working on Graph Diffusion Models
* You can reach out at [benjamin.honore@epfl.ch], I would be very happy to discuss !

### Projects
* Graph Diffusion Models and Symmetry Breaking
This project is a research on a discrete flow matching model (DeFoG), that operates on graphs. Such models generate graphs that have properties in common, such as topological properties (planarity, cycles,...), or simply have the same underlying distribution (SBM,...). An interesting property of graphs is that they all have an underlying exact permutation symmetry. In particular, this means that a model operating on graphs should be aware of this constraint. In the literature, such symmetries have for example been introduced at the architecture level (e.g. equivariant models), or the symmetry can be effectively implemented via data augmentation.

In this project, we investigate the effect of breaking the graph permutation symmetry, by introducing positional encodings. The latter allow the model to distinguish a graph from its permutation, which a priori breaks the inherent structure of graphs. It has however been observed that this procedure could accelerate the convergence of the model, at the expense of sampling quality. Therefore, we are looking for a best compromise between benefitting from breaking the symmetry, while keeping a consistent representation of the symmetry.

### Coding Languages
> My main languages are python and C++, and I have also been working with Mathematica and MatLab.
