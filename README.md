### 🚀 Projects

#### 📊 Graph Diffusion Models and Symmetry Breaking

This project involves research on a discrete flow matching model (DeFoG) that operates on graphs. These models are designed to generate new graphs sharing common properties (like topological characteristics or underlying distribution).

* **The Challenge:** Graphs possess an exact permutation symmetry, meaning a model should be inherently aware of this constraint (e.g., using equivariant architectures).
* **My Investigation:** We explore the effect of intentionally **breaking** the graph permutation symmetry by introducing positional encodings. This procedure, while seemingly detrimental to the graph's inherent structure, has been observed to potentially **accelerate convergence**.
* **The Goal:** To find the optimal compromise that benefits from the acceleration provided by symmetry breaking while maintaining a consistent and high-quality representation of the graph symmetry.

#### ⚛️ Higgs Boson to 4 Leptons Decay Analysis

This project focused on leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to better disentangle complex background processes within the decay channel of the Higgs boson to four leptons ($H \rightarrow 4\ell$).

* **The Issue:** Traditional kinematical analyses can often be insensitive to the specific underlying **production process** of the Higgs boson.
* **The Solution:** Using supplemental data (such as associated jet information), a Neural Network was trained to separate different Higgs production modes.
* **My Contribution:** I developed an analysis pipeline to quantify the sensitivity of the trained DNN across various backgrounds, providing a comprehensive performance metric for the classification system.
